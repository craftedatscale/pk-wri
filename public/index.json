Key Ideas # India’s fisherwomen face not only economic instability but also the shrinking availability of open spaces to carry out value-added fishing activities. Women’s employment is given limited priority in India’s draft blue economy policy framework. A more inclusive policy framework, strengthening traditional coastal activities for women and creating job opportunities in sectors dominated by men, are key steps toward empowering fisherwomen, suggest experts. Shaila D’Mello wakes up at 4 a.m. to cook for her family and finish chores before she leaves for the jetty in Cacra village, located in Tiswadi taluka in Goa. Around 6.30 a.m., the fishing boats begin to arrive. One of them has her husband who had cast a net for sardines. Some of her neighbours give D’Mello and her husband a hand to pull in the 26-feet canoe onto the beach.\nFor the next one hour, the couple is engaged in sorting the fish. On days when the catch is plenty, they send the produce to the Panjim market. Today, it’s just enough to be consumed locally. Once the fishing work is done, D’Mello leaves for her day job – she works as a cook in some of the sprawling villas that are taking over the hillsides surrounding Cacra. Ever since the income from fishing began to diminish, D’Mello took up other jobs to supplement her family income. In the evening, she works as a part time municipal worker and sweeps the winding road to her fishing hamlet.\nDestructive fishing practices # D’Mello is the president of the All Goa Small Scale Responsible Fishers Union (AGSSRFU), an organisation dedicated to advocating for the rights and challenges of small-scale fisherfolk in Goa. The union has been vocal in addressing the urgent need to tackle illegal and destructive fishing practices, such as “bull trawling” and “LED fishing,” which are wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems.\nBull trawling involves two boats dragging a massive fishing net through the water leading to overfishing, significant bycatch, and severe damage to the seafloor while LED fishing uses powerful submersible light-emitting diodes to attract fish at night. Both of these illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) practices violate regional, national, and international fisheries laws and pose a serious threat to the health of marine life.\nSmall-scale fishers are also grappling with rising fuel costs, inadequate subsidies, and enforcement lapses; their calls for support have become increasingly urgent.\nDestructive fishing practices have impacted women involved in fisheries activities, says D’Mello. “For small-scale fishers like us, fishing is becoming increasingly challenging. Our livelihoods are at stake,” she says. Women are involved in all forms of activities around fishing – from sorting and cleaning to selling at the market and even door-to-door vending. They also dry fish and make value-added products, adds D’Mello.\nShaila D’Mello, one of the many fisherwomen of Cacra village, Tiswadi taluka, Goa, says that destructive fishing practices are impacting fisherwomen.

A 2024 paper on women in fisheries reports that, out of the four million marine fisherfolk, 47% are women, and among the 23 million inland fisherfolk, 44% are women. Women predominantly work in fish processing and marketing, with 86% of those involved in marketing within the marine sector being women. The report also highlights that women play a dominant role in post-harvest activities such as curing (drying), prawn peeling, processing, and working as labourers.\nFishers like D’Mello worry that while on the one hand the fish population in the sea is depleting, making fishing economically unsustainable, on the other hand, open spaces and commons to carry out production of value-added fishing activities are becoming inaccessible to them. “Government subsidies to small fisherfolks are also drying up or delayed inordinately. We are being forced out of our traditional livelihood,” she says, posing a question to policy makers working on steering India’s blue economy: “How does it plan to secure our livelihoods and provide us opportunities to thrive?”\nD’Mello’s words resonate with women and men engaged in fishing-based activities across India’s 7500-km coastline. General Secretary of the National Fishworkers Forum (NFF), Olencio Simoes, who represented India at the 8th General Assembly of the World Forum of Fisher Peoples (WFFP) held in Brazil in November 2024, says that despite being India’s biggest and oldest organisation of the fisherfolk community, the NFF was not invited to stakeholder consultations in drafting India’s blue economy policy framework. According to him, several projects under the framework are not in favour of fisherfolks. “Women are also particularly vulnerable and getting increasingly displaced from fishing-related activities,” he informs Mongabay India.\nLakshmi Kovvada, president of the Andhra Pradesh Traditional Fishworkers Union, affiliated to the NFF, is worried about the numbers of fisherwomen who are forced to look for work as domestic help. “Being a fisherman is challenging, and the fate of fisherwomen is even worse,” she says.\nIndia’s booming blue economy # India’s Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 is a flagship initiative to promote responsible use of marine resources for economic growth, while ensuring ocean environmental protection. It aims to modernise ports, improve shipping infrastructure and promote renewable energy by 2047 with programmes such as Sagarmala, Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Deep Ocean Mission.\nFisherwomen at Carca, pull a boat out to the water.

Goal 14 of the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deals explicitly with the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources. The UN states that the blue economy should “promote economic growth, social inclusion, and the preservation or improvement of livelihoods while at the same time ensuring environmental sustainability of the oceans and coastal areas”.\nRecognising the potential of its blue economy, India is one of the few countries that has published a draft Blue Economy policy framework. The Government of India projects a potential income of $1 to $3 trillion through coastal sectors by 2030. Additionally, the sector which employs over four million coastal people, has the potential to generate millions of jobs. India’s Blue Economy policy framework – the Maritime India Vision 2030 (MIV 2030) and Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 – underlines efforts to inclusively realise India’s marine vision in all blue economy sectors. MIV 2030 outlines 150 initiatives aimed at propelling India to global maritime leadership.\nHowever, fisheries groups and researchers studying the draft policy are highlighting the limited prioritisation of women’s employment in the blue economy framework. An FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) report on the role and status of women in small-scale fisheries states that while women have been part of long-established coastal sectors traditionally, their participation is limited to the informal, indirect, and less lucrative blue economy activities. Women are limited by socio-cultural, economic, technological, and psychological factors that have emerged as barriers to their involvement in the ocean economy. As climate vulnerabilities increase and opportunities and spaces shrink, women are forced to migrate to other non-fishing jobs. Not addressing these issues at a systems level can impact the blue economy target to build sustainable livelihoods and achieve the transformative equity embedded under the UN charter.\nIn a 2024 paper on the major barriers to women’s participation and employment in coastal activities of India’s blue economy, researchers review the level of women’s exclusion or inclusion in India’s coastal activities and uncover the systemic inhibitors and enablers for women’s participation and employment.\nLead researcher Matovu Baker says that the research dealt with the question of exploring pathways for women’s empowerment in coastal activities. “India’s focus on developing its blue economy and the Government of India’s investments in coastal infrastructure provide a great opportunity to empower coastal women, who have historically been involved in its less lucrative economic activities. Our research uses a ‘system thinking’ perspective to highlight the interconnections of various drivers that kickstart avenues for women’s empowerment,’” he says.\nCoastal women face marginalisation, are severely underrepresented in leadership and decision-making roles. They are also vulnerable to environmental risks due to climate change. For instance, women engaged in coastal paddy cultivation in Sunderbans, West Bengal, and seaweed farming in Tamil Nadu, are increasingly facing challenges from pollution, climate change, and loss of land.\nWomen sort through the day’s catch at a dock in Mumbai. Among marine fisherfolk, 47% are women, and 44% among inland fisherfolk. Women largely work in fish processing, marketing, and post-harvest activities such as curing, and prawn peeling.

Chime Youdon, head of the Blue Economy and Climate Change cluster at the maritime think-tank, National Maritime Foundation, says she believes in the importance of integrating co-management and co-ownership frameworks to enhance the contributions of coastal women, particularly in conservation-related activities.\n“A significant portion of women’s livelihoods in coastal regions depends directly on marine ecosystems. As custodians of traditional ecological knowledge, women play a vital role as the primary guardians of these ecosystems, ensuring their preservation. Their work not only sustains local communities but also makes a tangible contribution to India’s GDP,” says Youdon.\nHowever, these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change, posing a direct risk to the livelihoods of the women who rely on them. Alongside environmental challenges, coastal women often face barriers to securing funding and institutional support, further limiting their resilience and economic stability, she explains.\nYoudon emphasises that coastal women are key stakeholders in the blue economy and conservation efforts. “Their voices and perspectives must be acknowledged, valued, and integrated into policy frameworks to ensure sustainable and inclusive development.”\nCoastal women’s work # While discussing women’s participation in the different sectors of India’s blue economy framework, the 2024 study notes that the fisherwomen involved in marine fishing comprise only 19% of the total labour force, but women form 81% of workforce managing inland fishing activities. The low participation of women becomes apparent when we look at the ratio of fisherfolk employed in marine versus inland fishing – only 18% of the total fisherfolk are engaged in inland fishing versus 82% in marine fishing, as per figures from Department of Fisheries, Government of India).\nIn the tourism sector, women’s employment is at a poor 12%. Youdon sees an opportunity for women in conservation-related coastal tourism businesses. She cites the example of mangrove safaris run by a women’s self-help group from the fisher community, that has built a sustainable business of taking tourists on boat rides in the creeks of Sindhudurg, making them both recreational and educational.\nIn the marine transport sector, the researchers note that while investments have increased with the launch of Sagarmala project, women’s engagement in port facilities, marine transport and shipping sectors is comparatively low. About 20 percent of the total workforce in maritime transport and shipping are women. However they are grossly underrepresented in some of the more profitable sectors – in 2019, of the 234,886 seafarers in India, only 985 were women (Matovu et al; GoI Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways). This calls for a shift in perception – both cultural and psychological – from the “traditionally safer roles” assigned to women.\nOverall, even as women have been limited by lack of access to skill, capacity and technology use, the draft blue economy framework provides an opportunity for promoting inclusive growth and employment for women. The opportunity is vast – for instance, Women’s Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in coastal states is fairly low – 22.8% in West Bengal, 26.4% in Odisha and 28.2% in Karnataka (all rural figures) being some of the lowest, and rural Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu being among the highest with 39.8% and 39.4% LFPR. The challenge before policymakers now is to ensure equitable opportunities for coastal women, and improve these figures.\nBuilding inclusivity into the policy framework, strengthening the historic and long established coastal activities that women have traditionally been part of, and creating opportunities for jobs in “non-traditional” male domains is needed. Access to funding and capacity can create pathways for women to move from small, vulnerable and less profitable informal businesses into newer sectors.\nExperts says that this requires viewing the issue through social, economic and institutional lenses for women’s empowerment. Improving representation, challenging perceptions and reframing communication to bring gender neutrality, co-designing culturally inclusive policies can empower and boost both inclusivity and economy.\nCredits # Banner image: Fisherwomen (including D’Mello) at work in Carca village.

Key Ideas # Plasticulture, the application of synthetic polymer-based technologies in agriculture, has found wide ranging uses, making it an integral part of food production today. Agricultural plastics are single-use or short-lived, and have been found to be a major source of micro and nanoplastics in the soil, which can have a long term impact on our health and environment. Experts suggest that it is time to recognise the chemical and ecotoxicological aspects of agriplastics and developed more sustainable alternatives. A glimpse of the scale # Sridhar Jayagouda, a young farmer in Alarwada village on the outskirts of Belagavi city in Karnataka, is preparing for the monsoon crop of paddy by clearing beds of capsicum his family recently harvested. Once the plants are uprooted, he pulls out thin films of plastic covering the raised soil beds. That’s about 40,000 feet or 12 km of single-use plastic mulching sheet from his five-acre farm, every season.\n“What other alternatives do farmers have?” Jayagouda asks. Plastic mulching is economical, it suppresses weed growth and reduces cost of labour significantly. “Our production has improved,” he says. Like many other farmers in this fertile swath of north Karnataka, Jayagouda adopted plastic mulching and drip irrigation five years ago.\nAgriculture today is awash with plastics. Used in applications such as mulch films, shade nets, polyhouses, irrigation pipes, pond liners, and storage silos, plastics are integral to food production, processing, marketing, and consumption. They are also found in polymer-coated agrochemicals.\nJayagouda represents a growing number of Indian farmers who have shifted from traditional methods of using biomass mulch and manual weeding to plastic films fitted snugly over raised beds. Mulching, which involves covering soil beds to suppress weed growth, evaporation, and improve the microclimate around the roots, boosts productivity.\nThe growth of plasticulture # Plasticulture is the application of plastics in agriculture. Introduced in India in the 1980s, it has seen exponential growth in the last decade. Plastic mulch, along with drip irrigation, is used in about 90% of “protected agriculture”, the cultivation of high-value horticulture crops in greenhouses, according to the agricultural scientists Mongabay India spoke to.\nPolymer mulch of 15 to 30 micron thickness is among the fastest growing technologies of plasticulture; it is now being applied in open fields across the country. For context on thickness, plastic carry bags with thickness less than 120 microns are banned in India, as prescribed by the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.\nA one-acre farm requires approximately 8000 feet or 2.4 km of plastic mulch, most of which is single-use plastics. In the long term, the degradation and breakdown of these agri-plastics into micro and nano-plastic particles (MNPs) poses a potentially irreversible threat to food safety and security.\nSridhar Jayagouda near his chilli plantation. He recently cleared his capsicum crop on his five-acre farm. Like other farmers in the village, he uses plastic mulching and burns the several thousand feet of single-use plastic films used for mulching after the harvest.

Although it has raised concerns about quality and regulation, the impact of agricultural production and consumption on microplastics in food is not widely discussed.\nFood systems are a major driver of plastic pollution. Microplastics (diameter less than five millimetres) and nanoplastics (diameter less than one micrometre) are everywhere, accumulating in soil, water, and our food. Historically, micro and nano plastics in the deepest reaches of oceans have been under focus, but now researchers say that MNPs in soil, sediments and freshwater may be an estimated four to 23 times higher, depending on the environment. They have been detected in the tissues and organs of terrestrial and marine life. Researchers warn of potentially life-threatening effects from plastic pollution, with raised risk of stroke and heart attack linked to MNPs in blood vessels. Polypropylene fibres have been found abundantly in human lungs, pointing at inhalation as a route of microplastic exposure; its presence in human faeces has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease; and MNPs were found in all the human placenta tested for a study.\nIn 2019, agriculture value chains used 12.5 million tonnes of plastic and food packaging contributed to 37.3 million tonnes globally, according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO, 2021). It forecasts a 50% increase in demand for agriplastics by 2030. Moreover, only about five percent of plastics used is recycled.\nIndia’s Ministry of Agriculture states that the agricultural plastic industry forecasts the global demand for greenhouse, mulching and silage films to increase by 50 percent from 6.1 million tonnes in 2018 to 9.5 million tonnes in 2030.\nIn India, the issue of plastic pollution in agriculture has largely been overlooked — plasticulture is being celebrated for its role in ushering in a “second green revolution” in food production. The Indian government supports this approach by offering 50% subsidies on various plasticulture applications, particularly to boost horticultural production.\nClimate change as a driver # Adverse climatic events have increased the popularity of plastic use in India, say Indian agricultural scientists. “Plasticulture technology like micro irrigation with mulching helps farmers combat situations such as heat waves,” says Rakesh Sharda, project coordinator, All India Coordinated Research Project on Plastic Engineering in Agricultural Structures and Environment Management, ICAR-Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering and Technology, Ludhiana.\nHowever, plastics consist of a complex mix of over 16,000 different chemicals, with around a quarter known to be hazardous to human health. These chemicals can leach out throughout the plastic lifecycle, providing direct pathways for toxic substances to enter the food chain.\nIn plastics in agriculture, this process is influenced by factors such as sunlight, mechanical degradation, exposure to various chemicals and pH levels. Global warming could also exacerbate this. Studies indicate that heatwaves hasten polymer degradation and scientists are calling for a revision of polymer safety specifications, so they are more resilient against rising temperatures.\nWhile plastic-based solutions may improve food production and farmer profitability in the short term, the challenge of retrieving and recycling it is enormous, and plastic waste management value chains are poor. For instance, in the absence of an alternative, most farmers, including Jayagouda, burn the plastic mulch films after use, oblivious of the pollutants they are releasing into the air, soil and water in the process.\nYoung chilli plants grow on plastic mulch in Alarwada village, Belagavi, Karnataka. Plastic is a complex mix of different chemicals which can leach out, providing direct pathways for toxic substances to enter the food chain. Image by Priyamvada Kowshik for Mongabay. Food security and environmental safety today face a range of conflicting challenges. “Some plastic applications, such as mulch, can reduce the use of water, pesticides, and herbicides in some cases, and are cost-effective for farmers. However, the impacts on soil health and the subsequent effects on food production, food security, and nutrition are only beginning to gain mainstream attention, and they are raising concerns among policymakers,” says Joe Yates of the London School of Tropical Medicine, who, along with fellow scientist Megan Deeney, is on the Working Group on Food Systems of the Scientists Coalition for Effective Plastics Treaty.\nWith mounting evidence of the adverse impacts of micro and nanoplastics, scientists are urging countries to take action. However, this global call to action to address plastic pollution is in conflict with national agendas focused on increasing food production and farmer income.\nMore plastics for food security # Feeding a global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 exerts a great deal of pressure on the environment. Agricultural production has led to 70% of the groundwater extraction and 75% of deforestation, globally. In India, agriculture presents additional challenges of low productivity, improper use of natural resources, and now, increased frequency of climatic events. Precision agriculture, also known as protected area farming, a farming management strategy that uses technology to improve agricultural production and sustainability, poses a solution.\n“Currently, 275,000 ha are covered by precision agriculture in India. Of this, over 90% is covered by plastic mulch, which has seen a steep rise in use in the past decade,” points out Rajesh Kumar Singh, head of department, Hydrology and Engineering, Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Dehradun. Singh was the former Project Coordinator of All India Coordinated Research Project (Plasticulture Engineering \u0026amp; Technology), ICAR.\nSouth Goan farmer Salvador D’Souza manages an integrated organic farm where he is experimenting with black plastic mulch for his pineapple crop. Single-use plastic mulching replacing biomass raises the question of whether we are trading short-term agronomic benefits for long-term environmental damage. Image by Priyamvada Kowshik for Mongabay. The National Committee for Precision Agriculture and Horticulture (NCPAH, earlier known as National Committee for Plasticulture in Agriculture and Horticulture) has the mandate to promote plasticulture, and recommend suitable policy measures, through various central and state government schemes and mission programmes.\nIts report on the Impact Assessment of Indian Precision Agriculture and Plasticulture Sector Post COVID-19, reveals that farmers who used plastic mulch reported a 20-30% increase in crop yields, with better quality produce that year. Farmers also reported a “reduction of 90-95% of manual labour for weeding and increase in irrigation interval”.\nDrip irrigation for water conservation # Drip irrigation efficiency is 90% as opposed to 38% of surface irrigation, says Singh. However, drip irrigation uses HDPE (High-density Polyethylene) pipes. The main pipes are covered and buried in soil, for 10 to 15 years. “Around 69 million ha of cultivable land has the potential for drip irrigation, which will amount to substantial water saving,” he adds. Similarly, greenhouses and polytunnels increase productivity up to four fold. In his 2018 report titled Status of Plasticulture Technologies in India, Singh says agricultural output can be increased by Rs. 74,000 crores through plasticulture.\nThe multifarious applications of plastics has spawned the growth of micro, small and medium manufacturing units for plasticulture products. About 50,000 plastic processing plants and 18,000 injection moulding plants are active across India. However information on the regulatory environment is hard to come by. As per a report by the NCPAH, India is the third largest user of plastic after the U.S. and China, even though its per capita consumption of 6 kg (to 9.7 kg in some reports) is lower than the world average of 26 kg.\nWhile not all plastics may be replaced with safer and more sustainable alternatives, products like single-use plastic mulching replacing biomass raises the question of whether we are trading short-term agronomic benefits for long-term environmental damage.\n“Once long-term plastic, microplastics, and nanoplastics pollution begins to threaten food security, there may be little chance of recovery. The harms caused by pesticides and herbicides are relatively well understood, but the role of these chemicals in many food system plastics is less recognised,” says Yates, explaining the pathways through which these chemicals of concern enter the environment.\nThe hidden cost of spotless choice # The political economy of agriculture and food policies plays a role in shifting practices. In Tamil Nadu’s Chengalpattu and Viluppuram districts, watermelon farmers began to adopt plastic mulch once traders began to prefer melons grown on plastic mulch.\nPapaya plants on raised soil beds covered in mulch in Belagavi. Plasticulture is being celebrated for its role in ushering in a second green revolution in food production in India, overlooking the level of plastic pollution it is causing in farm lands. Image by Priyamvada Kowshik for Mongabay. Ajay T.M., joint managing trustee of Magasool, a Chennai-based trust that works on reducing farm inputs and improving farmer income says, “Ten years ago about 10% of the farmers used plastic mulch, today 60% to 70% have adopted it. Melons develop a discolouration where the fruit rests on soil bunds, which does not occur when bunds are covered in plastic mulch. These spotless fruits are preferred by export markets, and customers,” says Ajay, adding that unless consumer awareness and preference shifts from beautiful-looking produce to chemical-free produce, farmers will comply.\n“Agricultural pollution needs the same kind of attention as industrial pollution,” says Soumik Banerjee, member of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) Kisan Swaraj network. While it may not be possible to replace all plastic applications, Banerjee says that traditional agriculture provides alternative solutions to some. “Practices such as multi-cropping and intercropping are a good alternative to plastic mulching,” he says.\nAs Ajay says, farmers need suitable and sustainable alternatives that don’t impact their incomes or increase labour, and are as effective as plastic.\nA sustainable solution is in linking agricultural intensification with ecosystem protection, backed by sustainable technological innovation. “Given the scale and magnitude of the plastics crisis, farmers and consumers cannot solve it alone. Responsibility for systemic change lies at a much higher level. When UN Member States resolved in 2022 to negotiate a legally binding agreement on plastics pollution, they recognised that the world needs systems-level, globally coordinated action,” says Yates.\nCredits # Banner image: Strawberries grown in Germany using plastic mulching.
